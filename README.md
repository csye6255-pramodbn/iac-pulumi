## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup

### Bucket Creation
- A bucket has been created in GCP for storage purposes.

### Service Account
- A Service Account has been created.
- The `Storage Admin` role is attached to this Service Account for necessary permissions.
- An access key has been generated for this Service Account.

## AWS Setup

### DynamoDB
- A DynamoDB table has been created for database needs.

### Lambda Function
- A Lambda function has been established.
- Lambda Code is passed as zip file through pulumi
- Environment Variables:
  - GCP private access key
  - GCP bucket name
  - DynamoDB table name
- IAM Role and Permissions:
  - Role: Basic Execution Role
  - Permissions:
    - `sns:Subscribe`
    - `sns:Receive`

- The Lambda function is subscribed to this SNS topic.
- SNS is configured as a triggering point for the Lambda function.

### EC2 Userdata
- SNS Region and ARN are passed in the EC2 userdata.
- This allows the application running on EC2 instances to access SNS.

## Hosted Zone

## Prerequisites
1. Install Python on your local system
2. Install Pulumi on your local system
3. Setup an AWS account
4. Install AWS CLI and setup a profile in your local system
5. Clone this repo in you local system and go inside that directory

## How to set up the pulumi environment before executing
Run the following commands:
1. python -m venv venv
2. venv\Scripts\activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. pulumi plugin install
5. pulumi stack init [stack_name]
6. pulumi stack select [stack_name]

## How to create resources (executing pulumi)
1. pulumi up


Once "pulumi up" is run, the aforementioned resources would be created using the default variables.

## CLI Commands
In order to create the above network stack using self-defined variables, you may customize the command mentioned below and run it:

pulumi config set <key> <value>

Example:
pulumi config set aws:profile dev ; pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1 ; pulumi config set vpc_name My-VPC1 ; pulumi config set vpc_cidr 10.200.0.0/16 ; pulumi config set public_subnets_cidr '[ "10.200.1.0/24", "10.200.2.0/24", "10.200.3.0/24" ]' ; pulumi config set private_subnets_cidr '[ "10.200.4.0/24", "10.200.5.0/24", "10.200.6.0/24" ]' ; pulumi config set instance_name MyInstance ; pulumi config set ami_id ami-0e58206c8b17a9a3c ; pulumi config set keypair_name mykey ; pulumi config set num_instances 1 ; pulumi config set instance_type t2.micro ; pulumi config set ebs_size 25 ; pulumi config set ebs_type gp2 ; pulumi config set delete_on_termination True ; pulumi config set accidental_termination False ; pulumi config set associate_public_ip True ; pulumi config set security_group_name "application security group"


You can replace with custom values in cli
or you can directly change the custom values in variables.py and then run "pulumi up"

Note 1: If you provide variables via the CLI, the default values will be overridden.

## How to destroy resources ?
Run the following command:
1. pulumi destroy

## How to delete the stack ?
1. pulumi stack rm [stack_name]

If you have created resources using custom variables, make sure to pass the variables as well with the above command

Note: If you're using custom variables, please ensure that vpc_cidr, public_subnet_cidr and private_subnets_cidr values are from the same subnet.

## How to create multiple infrastructures using pulumi ?
You can use pulumi stacks, commands are:
1. pulumi stack init [stack_name]
2. pulumi stack select [stack_name]

(stacks can be dev, prod, test, demo)
